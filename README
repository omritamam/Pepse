TODO endless world implementation


the trees implementation was challenging and we changed it a few times. eventually we settled on the following
implementation:
-Tree class acts as a tree manager which adds and deletes trees in range
-SingleTree class represents a single tree composed of a trunk and a tree top made of leaves
-LeafTraitsFactory class defines the shape/leaves density and color of a tree top
-TreeTop class manages the leaves of a specific tree
-Leaf class represents a single leaf


TODO dilemmas


we implemented several bonuses in our project:
1. the tree height is random so that the base height is 10 blocks, and there's a 0.1 chance to add another
block. more blocks will be added until the random factor fails.
2. we added an energy bar under avatar. the bar follows the avatar and changes it's color according to the
amount of energy left - 0-20 is red, 21-90 is blue, 91-100 is green.
3. different trees have different base colors according to a random factor (depends on seed). there are 3
options for colors.
4. different trees have different shapes/leaves density according to a random factor (depends on seed). there
are 4 options - square shape, plus shape, triangle shape and a tall rectangle shape.
